OUR RETROSPECTIVE TALK

Things we did right: 
    - We had a great plan, everything seemed to be comportmentalized
    - We did pull request correctly, albeit small pull requests
    - We implemented MUI on the menu page
    - We got 3 pages working for a time 
    - WE STAYED POSITIVE and COMMUNICATED on what was being worked on


Things we did wrong: 
    - We should have left more details where we left off
    - Could have been more organized with all the reducers and links
    - We should have created a checklist, instead of just having a giant list
    - Create a freeform 
    

Other comments...
    We got the menu, customerinfo, checkoutform, although ran into some obstalces to get base functionality working.
