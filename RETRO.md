2. Go to settings -> Collab/teams -> Add github people -> Give "Write Access"

For Collaborators
3. Go to repo -> CODE -> Copy SSH Key 
4. In Terminal, Cd prime/tanzanite
5. Git clone SSH KEY
6. cd into folder
7. code .

Once in code 
8. In terminal type git branch (This tells you what branch you are on)
9. git branch "feature-...." (This creates a branch)
10. git checkout "feature-..." (This brings you into the branch you typed)

---DO YOUR EDITS NOW---
